# Playing Card Models
Inspired by docm77's [S10E26 of Hermitcraft](https://youtu.be/yb9VvNva9Pc?si=GEDGSzc9RdpObUgf), I created custom models for playing cards in Minecraft. 

The pack adds custom model data to the Carved Pumpkin and Paper items, from ids `52000` to `52052`.

The model and textures were created using [BlockBench](https://www.blockbench.net/)
