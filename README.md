# Playing Card Models
Inspired by docm77's [S10E26 of Hermitcraft](https://youtu.be/yb9VvNva9Pc?si=GEDGSzc9RdpObUgf), I created custom models for playing cards in Minecraft. 

The pack adds custom model data to the Carved Pumpkin and Paper items, from ids `52000` to `52052`.

Additionally, I generated a datapack that defines a single command `cards:deck` that summons a bundle with one of each card model.

# Usage
1. Place the `PlayingCards_vX.X.X` folder in your resource packs folder and select the resource pack in Minecraft to load the models.

2. (Optional): Place the `PlayingCards_datapack_vX.X.X` folder in the datapacks folder of a Minecraft world. Run the function by calling
```
\function cards:deck
```

The model and textures were created using [BlockBench](https://www.blockbench.net/)
